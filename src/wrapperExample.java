// using primitive data type as an object is known as wrapper class
// java is passing by value in function not by reference
// but when object is used then pass by reference occurs
// final variables are not changed on later only when primitive data type
// final variable have to be initailed

// final int a = 10;

// when a non primtive is final you cannot reassign it
